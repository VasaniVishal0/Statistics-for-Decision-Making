# Statistics for Decision Making â€“ Real Estate Data Analysis

This project is part of a **Statistics for Decision Making** assignment.  
It applies Python-based statistical techniques to analyze **real-world property price data** from Australia.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The analysis explores property trends and probabilities using hypothesis testing and descriptive statistics.

**Dataset:** `property.csv` (Real estate prices in Australia)

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy  
- SciPy (for statistical testing)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## ðŸ§  Objectives
1. **Hypothesis Test (Altona)**  
   Test whether the average property price in *Altona* is greater than \$800,000.

2. **Seasonal Comparison (2016)**  
   Compare property prices between *summer* and *winter* months of 2016.

3. **Probability of No Car Parking (Abbotsford)**  
   Calculate the probability that 3 out of 10 properties sold have no car parking.

4. **Probability of 3 Rooms (Abbotsford)**  
   Estimate the likelihood of finding a property with 3 rooms.

5. **Probability of 2 Bathrooms (Abbotsford)**  
   Estimate the likelihood of finding a property with 2 bathrooms.

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Methods Used
- **One-sample t-test:**  
  Used to test if the average property price differs from a hypothesized value.

- **Two-sample t-test (Welchâ€™s test):**  
  Used to compare prices between two independent groups (seasons).

- **Binomial Probability Distribution:**  
  Used to calculate discrete probability outcomes (e.g., no car parking).

- **Descriptive Statistics & Visualizations:**  
  Includes histograms, boxplots, and probability charts.
